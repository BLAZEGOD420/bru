# BRU Password Manager
This project is a successor to bru.txt, which held all of my passwords. In short, bru.py and .exe seek to improve on two shortcomings of bru.txt: user interface and security.

In terms of user interface, BRU features the ability to add, edit, and delete passwords, which are stored alongside the username and service pertaining to the password. The user also has the ability to search for passwords based on the corresponding service. To copy the username, password, or even the service, the user simply clicks on the desired field and it is saved to the device's clipboard. For security, BRU encrypts all passwords locally with a master password that the user provides.
