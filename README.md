# bru
This project is a successor to bru.txt, which held all of my passwords. In short, bru.py and .exe seek to improve on two shortcomings of bru.txt: user interface and security.

In terms of user interface, BRU features the ability to add, edit, and delete passwords, which are stored alongside the username and service pertaining to the password. The user also has the ability to search for passwords based on the corresponding service.

In terms of security, BRU encrypts all passwords locally with a master password that the user provides.

Future Work:
 - Working .exe version of BRU for distribution
 - Option for users to backup passwords onto the cloud
